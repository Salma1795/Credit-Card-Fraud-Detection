# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud detection using decision tree algorithm

# Scope:
The scope of this document is about a proposed classifier to detect which customers are engaged in credit card fraud activity. As credit card fraud is increasing considerably with the development of modern technology and the global superhighways of communication. Credit card fraud costs consumers and the financial companies billions annually, also the fraudsters continuously try to find new rules and tactics to commit illegal actions. In proposed system, creating a classification model based on decision tree and k-fold algorithms and classify rules for credit card fraud detection. By the implementation of this approach in fraud detection systems, financial losses due to fraudulent transactions can be decreased more.


# Dataset information
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in 2019 & 2020. A total of 13280 records and 22 features are collected for use in this experiment. There are some enhancements have been done on this dataset to prepare it to work in the proposed algorithms perfectly.
